              The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera
              native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body;
              short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of
              its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger
              than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
              forming groups called prides.
