              The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera
              native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body;
              short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of
              its tail.

            <p>
              A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and
              cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
              on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;

              The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and
              a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its
              dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An
              apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and
              wild boar.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least
              93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western
              and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas
              of Southeast and South Asia and China. What remains of the range
              where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots
              from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical
              forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single
              Indonesian island, Sumatra.

              A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of the leopard
              (Panthera pardus) and the jaguar (Panthera onca). Black panthers
              of both species have excess black pigments, but their typical
              rosettes are also present. They have been documented mostly in
              tropical forests

              In 1788, Jean-Claude Delamétherie described a black leopard that
              was kept in the Tower of London and had been brought from
              Bengal.[1] In 1794, Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer proposed the
              scientific name Felis fusca for this cat, the Indian leopard (P.
              p. fusca).[2][3] In 1809, Georges Cuvier described a black leopard
              kept in the Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes that had been brought
              from Java. Cuvier proposed the name Felis melas

            <p>
              The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), commonly known as the ounce, is
              a species of large cat in the genus Panthera of the family
              Felidae. The species is native to the mountain ranges of Central
              and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List
              because the global population is estimated to number fewer than
              10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by
              2040. It is mainly threatened by poaching and habitat destruction
              following infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and
              subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft),
              ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan
              Plateau to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the
              northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the
              monotypic genus Uncia. Since phylogenetic studies revealed the
              relationships among Panthera species, it has since been considered
              a member of that genus. Two subspecies were described based on
              morphological differences, but genetic differences between the two
              have not yet been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a
              monotypic species. The species is widely depicted in Kyrgyz
              culture.
